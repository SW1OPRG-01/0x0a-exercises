# 0x0a Exercises

There are two ways to run the code:
- Use the launch configuration 'Build and Run' in `launch.json`
  - Select (`Command`+`Shift`+`D`/`CTRL`+`Shift`+`D`)
  - Press 'Build and Run' in the top left part of the screen 
- Use the terminal
  - Make sure you're in the workspace directory (`0x0a-exercises`), and 
  - type `g++ -g -std=c++11 src/*.cpp -o build/0x0a-exercises.out` into the terminal.
  - if the code compiled succesfully, you'll have a file in the 'build' directory named `0x0a-exercises.out`
  - run the program from the workspace directory with the `./0x0a-exercises.out`
